# k-nearest-neighbors

Using the KNN, this project aims to classify tweets into positive, negative, or neutral. The code includes the complete pipeline from loading the data to
preprocessing and then computing the distance list. using the distance matrix we are able to infer the lable of the query example more quicky instead of computing
distance everytime. To optimize the inference problem we also applied different search technique namely quick select. All the accuracies and time taken are reported in the notebook.
